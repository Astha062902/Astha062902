## Hi, I'm Astha Panda üëã

I'm a Frontend Developer and machine learning enthusiast. My journey began with machine learning, evolving into frontend development. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and am always open to exciting opportunities and collaborations.

There's something about writing code and bringing ideas to life that is truly exhilarating. I've always been an artist at heart, and I strive to infuse that artistry into every line of code I write. If you have a unique idea, let‚Äôs connect!
